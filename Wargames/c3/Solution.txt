## See that '==' ? Its a clue that '0FNRVMlM0ElMjlVLkRJRC0lM0VJVCUyMQ==' may be an encoded base64 string
## But notice one thing, in base64 the length of the string must be multiples of 4 but, the string length is 35,
## Therefore remove 3 chars from the start and make it 'RVMlM0ElMjlVLkRJRC0lM0VJVCUyMQ==' Now,

$ echo RVMlM0ElMjlVLkRJRC0lM0VJVCUyMQ== | base64 -d
ES%3A%29U.DID-%3EIT%21

## As you can see, There is something written as "YES U DID IT" (maybe the encoding was done using different char set)
## All these commands must be run in the same dir where the image file lies. (Linux)
